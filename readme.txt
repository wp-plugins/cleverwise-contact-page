Creates a professional contact page including web form (unlimited subjects & departments), emails, phones, faxes, hours, addresses.

== Description ==

<p>Do you find it a hassle to create a nice looking contact page?</p>

<p>Well the easy method has arrived! Once this plugin has been installed you'll be able to create a clean professionally structured contact page complete with an online web form.</p>

<p>You are able to display key information such as your organization's name, mailing address(es), hours, email address(es), phone number(s), and fax number(s).  You may be thinking what if I don't have or want all of that information on the page.  No problem.  The layout is totally adjustable by  allowing for the omission of information and even altering the order in which it is displayed!  However this plugin goes a step further by protecting any email addresses you display.</p>

<p>Most email addresses are displayed as-is on a webpage.  This allows for bots to easily scan the code and grab them.  This in turn results in more spam and unwanted email.  This plugin doesn't leave your email addresses that open.  You are provided with an easy way to convert your email addresses so that your visitors will still see them but will fool most bots!  How is that for cool?  This step is optional but it is so easy you'll want to do it.</p>

<p>Now let's turn our attention toward the web form.  This plugin will display a web form on the page so your visitors can easily send you email.  You are able to setup unlimited topics/subjects with each topic being sent to an email address.  So for example you could have "Technical Support", "Billing Questions", "Website Feedback", etc.  As stated there is no limit and each topic will map (or go) to an email address.  If you are wondering you can repeat email addresses if desired.</p>

<p>This form has been designed to protect you from bots.  For starters none of the email addresses listed with the topics are displayed anywhere on the page or in its code.  Thus bots will find no email accounts to add to their spam list.  Second an unique name is generated for the topic field to prevent common field names and make it harder for bots.  Third there are fake fields to fool bots.  This works because many bots will fill out all fields in a form, which will cause the form to error out.  All this is done without annoying captchas and is transparent to your visitors.</p>

<p>The plugin allows you to change/alter the text in the web form and messages displayed by the system.  This way if you use a language other than English or simply want to alter the text to fit your style go for it! Also if the error and success message blocks don't match your site's design concept you are easily able to edit the html code.  You even have the ability to custom set the CSS class names used for the textboxes, select list, and submit button!</p>

<p>Plus if all this wasn't enough the contact page is coded in responsive design meaning it is ready for mobile!  The web form will simply drop below the rest of your contact information on smaller resolutions.</p>

<p>Language Support: Should work for all languages that use the A-Z alphabet. While the default language is English you are able to easily edit the text displayed to visitors.  The only limitation is possible removal of unknown characters outside standard A-Z.</p>
